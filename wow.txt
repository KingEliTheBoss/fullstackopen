"npm create vite@latest appName --template react" command in console to create a new basic react application with vite
"npm install" to install it
"npm run dev" to run it
it resides in http://localhost:5173/

modify main.jsx to look like this:{

	import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

	import App from './App'

	ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)

}
make sure it exports App component



"import {useState, useEffect} from "react";
useState hooks to create state or pieces of state to a component to re-render it every time it is modified
useEffect hooks usually used for handling of external systems like requests to server, and others

props for components need to be handled carefully
Remember function that returns a function
Don't make components within components



JSON Server
"npm install -g json-server" to instal JSON Server globally in computer
run "json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json" to have JSON Server watch a specific file db.json
can also run "npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json" if you don't want to make global installation

a better way to run JSON Server is to "npm install json-server --save-dev" so it's only for development and only that project
and add it to the package.json scripts like: "server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json"
run JSON Server with "npm run server"



AXIOS
"npm install axios" to install library which simplifies communication between browser and server
import axios from "axios";
use correct methods for specific requests
make sure to use .then when request is successful and .catch for error handling
make server requests in separate services file(s)



styles can be put into css files or inside components code as like "inline"



Se obtuvo llave de api para openweathermap.org

esto es usado cuando se quiere guardar alguna llave para api externa, esta es de ejemplo
export VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0 && npm run dev // For Linux/macOS Bash
($env:VITE_SOME_KEY="54l41n3n4v41m34rv0") -and (npm run dev) // For Windows PowerShell
set "VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0" && npm run dev // For Windows cmd.exe

const api_key = import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY para obtenerla



"npm init" to create new minimal package.json file and start simple node application

"npm install express"

const express = require("express")



"npm install --save-dev nodemon"
nodemon lets you hot reload simple node applications
"dev": "nodemon index.js" in package.json to run with "npm run dev" in console



Use POSTMAN to test http request on the backend more easily

Can also use REST client plugin in VS Code, this could be better since the requests are stored inside the project and you have more control
Create a requests folder at the root of the project and create .rest files with the wanted requests, can separate requests with ###
